    <h1 style="color: yellow;">What is CSS ?</h1>
    <p id="p-1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
    <p id="p-2">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what<br>
        background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>
<div class="square">
    <p><b>Tip: </b>The word<b> cascading </b>means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you<br>
        set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless<br>
        you specify something else)!</p>
